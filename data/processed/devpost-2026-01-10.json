Or a mental health platform that helps users find resources and support networks. 🔵 TRACK 2: MACHINE LEARNING / AI The Challenge: \"Teach a machine to help.\" Build a project where AI or ML is central to producing insights, predictions, or actions. Idea: A browser-based AI tutor that analyzes a student’s practice problems in real-time and suggests personalized exercises to strengthen weak areas. Or an image recognition app that helps identify plant species for conservation projects. 🟣 TRACK 3: BEGINNER FRIENDLY The Challenge: \"Learn by doing.\" Build a functional project that demonstrates your growth and ability to ship a working solution. Idea: A simple to-do app with a clean interface to add, complete, and categorize tasks, or a mini-game built with Scratch or P5.js. Or a basic web tool that tracks personal habits or goals. 📌 Notes: Choose the track that best matches your project’s main purpose. Tracks are for categorization only; all projects compete equally for prizes. Projects must be functional, built during the hackathon, and follow the judging rubric.",
