      "description": "⛴️ Welcome to Shipyard: Creator Contest — an app-building challenge where real influencers enlist you to build, launch, and monetize an MVP app for their audience. In four weeks or less. ABOUT THE CHALLENGE Shipyard: Creator Contest is about building real, monetizable apps for influencers’ and their audiences. Rather than creating demos for judges, you’re tasked with shipping a working MVP for an influencer and their community. We’ve partnered with seven creators representing different niches, who’ve provided seven briefs about the kind of mobile app they — and their followers — are looking for. Browse the briefs, learn about the problem each influencer’s app is hoping to solve, and get stuck into building something real for a pre-validated audience willing to try (and pay for!) your app. Alongside our panel of judges, the influencers will pick seven winning apps. But you don’t just get cash. You gain real-world credibility, distribution through an established creator, and the opportunity to continue developing and monetizing your app beyond the hackathon. All participants will also receive our Shipping Container 📦 a digital bundle packed with exclusive perks and offers from our partners. Ready to cast off? Haul the anchor up and let’s go! ⚓️ HOW TO GET INVOLVED On January 15 the influencer briefs will drop: read summaries here on Devpost or watch the full brief on the official Shipyard website. Choose one influencer to build an app for, and get ideating! Design and build a working MVP mobile app for iOS or Android that fits your chosen brief Integrate RevenueCat and monetize your app — this can be in-app purchases or subscription offerings Submit your app on Devpost by February 12: include a demo video, written proposal, and access to the build (head to the Submission Requirements section for more detail) On February 26, we’ll announce our seven winners. You’ll be evaluated not just on technical execution, but on audience fit, product quality, and monetization potential — just like a real app launch. THE PRIZES The 7 winning app-builders don't just get paid, they get the opportunity to build and monetize their app with the creator and unlock a primed audience. $20,000 per winning app 7 winners Feature on RevenueCat official channels Long-term credibility (and bragging rights) Opportunity to connect with the briefing influencer These creators aren't just looking for a one-and-done MVP — they want a long-term, profitable app. If you ship the right thing, you might just discover a whole fleet of opportunities. THE TIMELINE Here's the shipping route for your challenge... Anchors aweigh January 15: Briefs are out and registration is open. Time to start building! All hands on deck January 15 – February 12: Four weeks to build and monetize your MVP. Land ho! February 12: Submit your link and demo video by 11:59pm PST. Captain's review February 12–14: Submissions are reviewed by judging panel and the creators. Dividing the loot February 26: Winners are announced! THE BRIEFS Each creator has provided you with a video brief, a problem statement, and some insights on their audience. You can watch all the briefs on the Shipyard website here. We’ve summarized each influencer’s brief below: Sam Beckman: Cross-platform power reminders Watch the brief Sam lives by reminders, but switching between Android and iOS means rebuilding his entire system from scratch. He wants a beautiful, fully functional reminders app on both iOS + Android with custom snoozes from notifications, powerful recurring rules, and true sync so dismissing once clears everywhere. Gabby Beckford (PacksLight): Dream-to-do challenges for ambitious women Watch the brief Gabby’s community is full of smart, adventurous women who want big trips and big life upgrades, but often get stuck between inspiration and action. Build an upbeat, motivating app that turns goals into daily micro-actions, with challenges, streaks/wins, tracking, and gamified moments that make progress feel fun (yes, confetti welcome). Josh (VisualFaktory): One portfolio to track them all Watch the brief Investors juggle stocks, gold, funds, fixed income, real estate, and more across multiple platforms — messy to track and hard to understand at a glance. Josh wants a single app where users can log everything, get real-time price updates where possible, set amortization/reminder alerts for non-listed products, and unlock premium risk + diversification analysis (like country/sector exposure). Simon (Better Creating): Minimalist AI coaching in your pocket Watch the brief Simon’s audience loves productivity, great design, and building systems — and he wants to bring coaching to more people. Create a clean, minimal mobile app where users can browse, create, and share AI coaches, add personal context/values, and start chatting immediately. No complex setup, just guidance at the right moment. Eitan Bernath: From saved recipe to dinner made Watch the brief Eitan wants to help people actually cook what they’ve been meaning to make. Think tools that turn inspiration into action: an app that can generate a grocery list from a recipe video/link, organize what you want to cook, and make it simple to go from “I saw this” to “it’s on the table.” Quin Gable: A trusted community for van-lifers to connect Watch the brief Dating and making friends on the road is hard when you’re always moving—and van life is a tight, protective community. Quin wants a van-life app with nomadic dating, activity-based friend finding, and even a paid 'builder help' section for van projects, with invite-only or verified access to keep it safe and intentional. Rebecca Louise: Money confidence for busy mums Watch the brief Rebecca hears it constantly: mums are short on time, want financial independence, and need practical help. Build an app that offers everyday money-saving guidance (shopping swaps, batch cooking, cost comparisons, home reno savings) plus an approachable path into investing basics so users can grow what they have, without overwhelm. RULES We're keeping it simple: Build the app you want. The only catch? You must use RevenueCat and monetize through RevenueCat. For full rules and all the Ts&Cs, go to the Rules tab on Devpost. Follow RevenueCat on Twitter @RevenueCat for the latest updates. Use #Shipyard2026 to join the conversation. You can also join the Shipyard Discord community here to connect with other participants.",
