AlamedaHacks is a student-run hackathon designed to inspire creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving. Our goal is to bring together bright young minds, foster collaboration with peers in tech, and create an inclusive space for students to learn, experiment, and push their skills to the next level. Why should you join AlamedaHacks? Build Something Awesome: Tackle meaningful problems and turn your ideas into functional projects. Collaborate & Connect: Work with other motivated students and coders Learn & Grow: Gain hands-on experience, expand your skills, and walk away with new knowledge, friends, and inspiration. Come ready to innovate, collaborate, and make your mark at AlamedaHacks What to Build (The Tracks) 🟢 TRACK 1: SOCIAL GOOD The Challenge: \"Make an impact.\" Build a project that addresses a meaningful real-world problem and improves lives or communities. Idea: A mobile app that connects volunteers to local environmental cleanup projects, tracking hours and impact for schools and neighborhoods. Or a mental health platform that helps users find resources and support networks. 🔵 TRACK 2: MACHINE LEARNING / AI The Challenge: \"Teach a machine to help.\" Build a project where AI or ML is central to producing insights, predictions, or actions. Idea: A browser-based AI tutor that analyzes a student’s practice problems in real-time and suggests personalized exercises to strengthen weak areas. Or an image recognition app that helps identify plant species for conservation projects. 🟣 TRACK 3: BEGINNER FRIENDLY The Challenge: \"Learn by doing.\" Build a functional project that demonstrates your growth and ability to ship a working solution. Idea: A simple to-do app with a clean interface to add, complete, and categorize tasks, or a mini-game built with Scratch or P5.js. Or a basic web tool that tracks personal habits or goals. 📌 Notes: Choose the track that best matches your project’s main purpose. Tracks are for categorization only; all projects compete equally for prizes. Projects must be functional, built during the hackathon, and follow the judging rubric.",
